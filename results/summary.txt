Minor page fault - the page is still in memory, but the memory management unit (MMU) does not know about it. (Common)

Major page fault - the page is only on disk and must be retrieved with the disk penalty. (Common, but more expensive)

Invalid page fault - when it goes to disk, not there (null pointer) or permission denial -> program terminates via "segmentation fault" and core is dumped.

The reason why major page faults are more difficult is because the OS will try to predict which pages you may want to access (via temporal or spatial locality)
